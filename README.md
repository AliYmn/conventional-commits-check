`conventional-commits-check` is a powerful and easy-to-use Python pre-commit hook that helps enforce [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) rules on your commit messages. It supports adding relevant emojis based on your commit types to enhance readability and bring some fun to your commit history! 🚀

## 📜 What are Conventional Commits?

Conventional Commits provide a lightweight convention for creating a clear and explicit commit history. By using this hook, you'll ensure that your commit messages follow this convention, making your versioning easier to manage and your collaboration more seamless.

## 💡 Features

- ✅ Enforces Conventional Commits rules on your commit messages.
- 🎨 Optionally adds context-specific emojis to the start of commit messages.
- 🛑 Blocks commits that do not conform to the Conventional Commits standard.
- 🔧 Allows for **custom commit types** and **custom emojis** via configuration.

## 🔧 Customization

You can customize the commit types and their associated emojis by modifying the `commit_types.yml` and `commits_check_config.yaml` files. These files allow you to define additional commit types and specify emojis for each type.

### Example : [`commit_types.py`](https://github.com/AliYmn/conventional-commits-check/blob/master/conventional_commits_check/commit_types.py)

```python
commit_types:
  {
    "access": {
        "description": "Improve accessibility.",
        "emoji": "♿️"
    },
    "analytics": {
        "description": "Add or update analytics or track code.",
        "emoji": "📈"
    },
    "animation": {
        "description": "Add or update animations and transitions.",
        "emoji": "💫"
    },
    "arch": {
        "description": "Make architectural changes.",
        "emoji": "🏗️"
    },
    "assets": {
        "description": "Add or update assets.",
        "emoji": "🍱"
    },
    "beer": {
        "description": "Write code drunkenly.",
        "emoji": "🍻"
    },
 .....
 .....
```

### Customizing Existing Emojis

You can also modify the emojis for existing commit types by updating the `commits_check_config.yaml`:

```yaml
additional_commit_types:
  feat:
    description: Introduce new features.
    emoji: 🎉
  fix:
    description: Fix a bug.
    emoji: 🛠️
```

## ⚙️ Installation

To add `conventional-commits-check` to your project, follow these steps:

1. **Update your `.pre-commit-config.yaml`:**

   In your project’s root directory, add the following:

   ```yaml
   repos:
     - repo: https://github.com/AliYmn/conventional-commits-check
       rev: v0.3.0  # Use the latest release version
       hooks:
         - id: conventional-commits-check
           stages: [commit-msg]
           args: ["--emoji-disabled"]  # Use this argument to disable emojis
   ```

2. **Install the pre-commit hook:**

   ```bash
   pre-commit install --hook-type commit-msg -f
   ```

3. **Install the `conventional-commits-check` package:**

   ```bash
   pip install -U conventional-commits-check
   ```

4. **Optional:** Update the pre-commit package:

   ```bash
   pre-commit autoupdate
   ```

## 🚀 Usage

Once the hook is added, it will automatically run each time you make a commit. The hook checks your commit message against Conventional Commits rules, optionally adds the appropriate emoji, and prevents non-conforming commits.
